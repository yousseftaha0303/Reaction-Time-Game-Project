# Reaction-Time-Game-Project
Embedded project (Reaction Time Game) By using the microcontroller TM4C123GH6PM:
This project aims to design a game using the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller where players respond to randomly lit LEDs by pressing corresponding switches, with reaction times displayed on an LCD. An ADC slider is used to specify the difficulty of the game. A light sensor is used to turn the game on and off, and UART is used to transmit game statistics to a PC.
